# CS111_images_as_2dlists
An assignment in my first college CS class (BU's CS111) where I wrote code to horizontally flip as well as perform matrix transpose on an image!

This code is to be used in conjunction with the PNG/ENG python encoder by Johann C. Rocholl at MIT. This was provided to me for education purposes for this problem set.
